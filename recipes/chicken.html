    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients </h3>
        <ul type="square">
            <li>3 cups sweet barbecue sauce </li>
            <li>1 cup Italian salad dressing</li>
            <li>4 bone-in chicken legs with skin</li>
            <li>Hickory wood chips as needed</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix barbecue sauce and salad dressing together.
            </li><p></p>
            <li>Put chicken legs in a large zip-top bag and pour sauce all over them. 
                Squeeze out the excess air and seal the bag.</li> <p></p>
            <li>Massage marinade into the chicken a bit, 
                then refrigerate for 4 hours.</li><p></p>
                <li>Remove chicken from the refrigerator; set bag on the counter and 
                    bring to room temperature, about 1 hour.
                </li><p></p>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-low heat and lightly oil the grate. 
                    Load a smoker box with wood chips and set on the grate.
                </li><p></p>
                <li>Remove chicken from the bag and transfer to the preheated grill. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, then flip, 
                    basting both sides with the remaining marinade.
                </li><p></p>
                <li>Continue to cook (with the lid closed and listening for flare-ups) until chicken is no longer pink at the bone
                     and the juices run clear, about 10 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
                </li><p></p>
                <li>Remove chicken to a platter and tent with foil. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
                </li><p></p>
